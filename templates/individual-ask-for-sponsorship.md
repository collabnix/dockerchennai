### Email to an individual asking if their company will sponsor

Hi [name],

My name is [name] and I am the Docker Community Leader in [city], meaning that I run the local Docker user group! 
You can check out our official chapter page and past events here: [link to chapter page]. I am emailing because we are currently looking for 
a  [Venue / food & drink] sponsor for our next event. Would you consider working with us as a local sponsor?

As a local sponsor, your organization’s logo will be included as a sponsor of the event on the chapter event page. We will also have your 
logo on our intro slide deck and / or thank you publicly in front of our attendees during the event. You can hand out swag to attendees at the 
event and say a few words and mingle at the beginning and end. 

Does this sound like something you’d be interested in? We’d love to have your support.

Best Wishes,

[name]
