### Response to someone asking if you can promo their event or company 

Hello, 

Thanks a lot for reaching out. 

We usually don't use our mailing list for advertising positions, but we welcome sponsors. 
By being a sponsor, you can pass a brief message to the mailing list and at the same time have a small (10 mins) technical presentation during 
one of our next Meetups, which is way more effective to reach potential candidates as they are more keen working for a company that does 
interesting things. 

If this sounds interesting to you, our next Meetup will be on the 15th of January (we'll announce it soon) and we would be more than 
happy to have you with us.
