### Email to all your group members asking for a sponsor 



Hi Everyone!

My name is [name] and I am the Docker Community Leader for this chapter:) 
I am emailing because I am planning our next event and we are currently looking for a  [Venue / food & drink] sponsor. 
Would your company like to work with us as a local sponsor? Or do you know someone who may be interested?

As a local sponsor, the organizationâ€™s logo will be included as a sponsor of the event on the chapter event page [link to chapter page]. 
We will also have your logo on our intro slide deck and thank you publicly in front of our attendees during the event. 
You can hand out swag to attendees at the event and say a few words publicly and mingle at the beginning and end. 

Are you able to help me with this? If so, please reply to this email and let me know!

Best Wishes,

[name]
